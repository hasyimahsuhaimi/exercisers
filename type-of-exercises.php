				<h3>Four Types of Exercise</h3>
				<br>
			  <p>The four main types of exercise are:</p>
				   <ul class="list-style2">
					 <li><p><strong>Endurance</strong>, also known as cardio or aerobic exercise, which increases your general fitness;</p></li>
					 <li><p><strong>Strength </strong>training, also known as resistance or muscle-building exercise, which increases your muscle strength;</p></li>
					 <li><p><strong>Balance</strong> exercises, that may also include some lower-body strength exercises, which improve your ability to balance; and</p></li>
					<li><p><strong>Flexibility </strong>exercises, which improve your overall ability to move your body around.</p></li>
				   </ul>
				   <p>Generally speaking, when most people talk about &lsquo;exercise&rsquo;, they tend to mean either endurance or strength training. This is especially true for people who use gyms. However, yoga and Tai Chi are well-known forms of exercise that increase balance and flexibility.</p>
					<p><strong>All four are important for your overall health, and particularly as you get older and may start to lose both fitness and muscle tone.</strong></p>
					
					 <hr>
					 
					<h3>Endurance exercise</h3>
					<p>Exercise to improve endurance is what most people think of when they are told that they should &lsquo;exercise more&rsquo;. The obvious forms include running, swimming, cycling, walking, playing tennis or other racquet sports, dancing and even gardening, especially activities like raking or digging.</p>
			 <p><strong>Basically, any activity that raises your heart rate for a prolonged period can be considered to be endurance exercise, because it improves your cardiovascular fitness.</strong></p>
					<p>Aerobic exercise has huge benefits for overall health, both mental and physical. It can help you to avoid chronic illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, and improve your well-being. Health authorities around the world generally recommend at least 150 minutes of this type of exercise each week, done at an intensity that raises your heart rate and makes you breathe faster.</p>

			 <h3>Strength exercises</h3>
			 <p><strong>Strength training increases your overall muscle strength. </strong>It helps to prevent injury by ensuring that your body is strong enough to do what you ask of it in other sports, or in life generally. It is particularly helpful for older people to do some resistance training, because we tend to lose muscle and bone density as we grow older.</p>
					<p>Strength training includes weight training, but also exercise such as use of a resistance band, or even just using your own body weight or gravity to work against.</p>
					<p>Strength training can focus on either particular muscle groups, or be general, to strengthen all your muscle groups. The exercises that you do will affect which muscle groups are strengthened.</p>
			 <hr>
		<h2>Balance exercises</h2>
			   <p><strong>Balance exercises are designed to improve your balance.</strong></p>
			<p>They are especially important for older people, because good balance helps to reduce the risk of falling. However, everyone can benefit.</p>
			<p>Many of us do balance exercises a lot of the time without thinking about it: if you ride a bicycle, you are practising balance all the time. However, if you don&rsquo;t, and especially if you find it hard to balance, it may be worth trying some exercises.</p>
			<p>Suitable exercises include:</p>
		
			 <hr>
			
			<h3>Flexibility exercises</h3>
			<p><strong>The final area of exercise is work to improve your flexibility, which basically means stretching. </strong></p>
			<p>Flexibility, like balance, is especially important for older people, because joints and muscles become less flexible with age. Flexibility makes it easier to do basic tasks like doing up shoelaces or looking over your shoulder when reversing your car.</p>
